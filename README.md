## ⚡ Heads Up!

Wondering why the shift from full-stack to security, especially when my GitHub screams full-stack mastery? It's all about staying ahead in the game. The job market and global tech trends are pivoting towards AI and security – the next frontier. While my heart beats for creation, the winds of change are blowing, and I'm sailing towards the future, adapting and evolving with the world's tech needs. Who knows, in 2025, we all might be needing security engineers protecting our assests in the web 3 space as much as we needed them in web 2.

Below you will find my Pinned Projects explained and summarized just in case.
